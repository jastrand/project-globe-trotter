## The requirements
Create a simple web interface using React which allows users to: 
a) Search for countries and display its full country name, capital, population and currency. This can be a simple list, but you can also get creative in how to vizualise these data points. 

b) Enter an amount in SEK and get the amount converted into local currency for each country. 

The data can amongst others be retrieved from the following open APIs:
- https://restcountries.eu for country information 
- http://fixer.io for exchange rates
